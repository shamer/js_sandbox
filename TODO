use scons to run single unit tests
batching tests into single runs through rhino (better performance)
generate HTTP batch pages for complete, in-browser tests
handle test runner failures (ie no output or no "PASSED: nn  FAILIED: mm")
hooks for other JS unit test libraries
complete cleanup, 'scons -c' should remove all of the generated files
jsdoc generation
dependency analyzer for proper inclusion and ordering
