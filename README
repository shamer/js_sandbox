This is a sandbox for javascript:
 * demonstrating build files
 * documentation
 * project structuring
 * unit testing
 * static js analysis
 * compilation

It's modeled after the Dr. Seuss story "The Sneetches".

To get started run the bootstrap.sh script. It'll pull down and build the
dependencies for the various tools used:
 * qunit
 * envjs
 * closure-linter

The following scons commands exist:
scons jstest
scons jslint
scons build/sneetches.min.js
